This project develops a smart chatbot that integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities 
with a tool-based agent. 
It routes user queries to either retrieve information from existing documents 
or execute specific tools for actions (such as updating user details or adding vendors). 
If the bot is unsure of an answer, it escalates the user to a human service queue.
